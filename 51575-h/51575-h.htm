<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">He</span> was a man with wide and patient eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grey, like the drift of twitch-fires blown in June<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, without fearing, searched if any wrong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might threaten from your heart. Grey eyes he had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under a brow was drawn because he knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So many seasons to so many pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of upright service, loyal, unabased<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the world seducing, and so, barren<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of good words praising and thought that mated his.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He carved in stone. Out of his quiet life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He watched as any faithful seaman charged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tidings of the myriad faring sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thoughts and premonitions through his mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sailing as ships from strange and storied lands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hungry spirit held, till all they were<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Found living witness in the chiselled stone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slowly out of the dark confusion, spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By life’s innumerable venturings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over his brain, he would triumph into the light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of one clear mood, unblemished of the blind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Legions of errant thought that cried about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His rapt seclusion: as a pearl unsoiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, rather washed to lonelier chastity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_80" id="page_80"></a>{80}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In gritty mud. And then would come a bird,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A flower, or the wind moving upon a flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A beast at pasture, or a clustered fruit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A peasant face as were the saints of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The leer of custom, or the bow of the moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swung in miraculous poise&mdash;some stray from the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of things created by the eternal mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In joy articulate. And his perfect mood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would dwell about the token of God’s mood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until in bird or flower or moving wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or flock or shepherd or the troops of heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It sprang in one fierce moment of desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To visible form.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then would his chisel work among the stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Persuading it of petal or of limb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or starry curve, till risen anew there sang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shape out of chaos, and again the vision<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of one mind single from the world was pressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the daily custom of the sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or field or the body of man.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">His people<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had many gods for worship. The tiger-god,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The owl, the dewlapped bull, the running pard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The camel and the lizard of the slime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ram with quivering fleece and fluted horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crested eagle and the doming bat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were sacred. And the king and his high priests<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_81" id="page_81"></a>{81}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Decreed a temple, wide on columns huge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should top the cornlands to the sky’s far line.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They bade the carvers carve along the walls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Images of their gods, each one to carve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he desired, his choice to name his god....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many came; and he among them, glad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of three leagues’ travel through the singing air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of dawn among the boughs yet bare of green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The eager flight of the spring leading his blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into swift lofty channels of the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud as an eagle riding to the sun....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An eagle, clean of pinion&mdash;there’s his choice.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Daylong they worked under the growing roof,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One at his leopard, one the staring ram,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he winning his eagle from the stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until each man had carved one image out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arow beyond the portal of the house.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They stood arow, the company of gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Camel and bat, lizard and bull and ram,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pard and owl, dead figures on the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Figures of habit driven on the stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By chisels governed by no heat of the brain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But drudges of hands that moved by easy rule.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proudly recorded mood was none, no thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plucked from the dark battalions of the mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And throned in everlasting sight. But one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God of them all was witness of belief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And large adventure dared. His eagle spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_82" id="page_82"></a>{82}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wide pinions on a cloudless ground of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glad with the heart’s high courage of that dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moving upon the ploughlands newly sown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dead stone the rest. He looked, and knew it so.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then came the king with priests and counsellors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many chosen of the people, wise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With words weary of custom, and eyes askew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That watched their neighbour face for any news<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the best way of judgment, till, each sure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None would determine with authority,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All spoke in prudent praise. One liked the owl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because an owl blinked on the beam of his barn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One, hoarse with crying gospels in the street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Praised most the ram, because the common folk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wore breeches made of ram’s wool. One declared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tiger pleased him best,&mdash;the man who carved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tiger-god was halt out of the womb&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man to praise, being so pitiful.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one, whose eyes dwelt in a distant void,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With spell and omen pat upon his lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a purse for any crystal prophet ripe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A zealot of the mist, gazed at the bull&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lean ill-shapen bull of meagre lines<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That scarce the steel had graved upon the stone&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_83" id="page_83"></a>{83}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saying that here was very mystery<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And truth, did men but know. And one there was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who praised his eagle, but remembering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lither pinion of the swift, the curve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That liked him better of the mirrored swan.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they who carved the tiger-god and ram,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The camel and the pard, the owl and bull,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lizard, listened greedily, and made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Humble denial of their worthiness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the king his royal judgment gave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all had fashioned well, and bade that each<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Re-shape his chosen god along the walls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till all the temple boasted of their skill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They bowed themselves in token that as this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never had carvers been so fortunate.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Only the man with wide and patient eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made no denial, neither bowed his head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already while they spoke his thought had gone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far from his eagle, leaving it for a sign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loyally wrought of one deep breath of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And played about the image of a toad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That crawled among his ivy leaves. A queer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Puff-bellied toad, with eyes that always stared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sidelong at heaven and saw no heaven there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weak-hammed, and with a throttle somehow twisted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond full wholesome draughts of air, and skin<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_84" id="page_84"></a>{84}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wrinkled lips, the only zest or will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The little flashing tongue searching the leaves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And king and priest, chosen and counsellor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Babbling out of their thin and jealous brains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed strangely one; a queer enormous toad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Panting under giant leaves of dark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sunk in the loins, peering into the day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their judgment wry he counted not for wrong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than the fabled poison of the toad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Striking at simple wits; how should their thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or word in praise or blame come near the peace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shone in seasonable hours above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The patience of his spirit’s husbandry?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They foolish and not seeing, how should he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spend anger there or fear&mdash;great ceremonies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Equal for none save great antagonists?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grave indifference of his heart before them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was moved by laughter innocent of hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chastising clean of spite, that moulded them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the antic likeness of his toad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bidding for laughter underneath the leaves.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He bowed not, nor disputed, but he saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those ill-created joyless gods, and loathed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw them creeping, creeping round the walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death breeding death, wile witnessing to wile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sickened at the dull iniquity<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_85" id="page_85"></a>{85}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">In panels for the carver set between<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The windows&mdash;there his chisel should be set,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was his plea. And the king spoke of him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scorning, as one lack-fettle, among all these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eager to take the riches of renown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One fearful of the light or knowing nothing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of light’s dimension, a witling who would throw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Honour aside and praise spoken aloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All men of heart should covet. Let him go<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of stars or cloud or summer’s folded sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through crop and wood and pastureland to sleep.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And watch the gods growing along the walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The row of carvers in their linen coats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took in his vision a virtue that alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_87" id="page_87"></a>{87}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Carving they had not nor the thing they carved.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knowing the health that flowed about his close<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Bred on a hill-top that seemed the most of the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until he travelled the valleys, and found what a wonder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of leagues from Gloucester lay to Stroud or Ciceter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">John Heritage was a tiler. He split the stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After the frosts, and learnt the laying of tiles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And was famous about the shire. And he was friendly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Cotswold nature, hearing the hidden rooks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Golden Vale, and the thin bleat of goats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the rattling harness of Trilly’s teams at plough,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Richard Parker’s scythe for many years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he went upon his tiling; and the great landmarks,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And he prospered, as men do. His little wage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet left a little over his wedded needs,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">About the Cotswolds, built of the royallest stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_96" id="page_96"></a>{96}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That’s quarried in England, until he could think of age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With an easy mind; and an acre of land was his<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where at hay-harvest he worked a little from tiling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making his rick maturely or damning the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That scattered the swathes beyond his fork’s controlling.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he trotted ajog to the town on market Thursdays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Driving a stout succession of good black geldings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That cropped his acre some twenty years apiece.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he was an honest neighbour; and so he grew old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And five strong sons, grizzled and middle-aged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Carried him down the hill, and on a stone<br /></span>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
